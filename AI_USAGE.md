## ðŸ”§ AI Tools Used

| Tool        | Purpose                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **ChatGPT** | Improving UI logic and code comments |
| **Gemini**  | Suggesting minor UI enhancements     |

> No AI was used for full code generation or core logic implementation.

---

## âœ¨ Effective Prompts Used

- "Can you suggest better Tailwind classes for spacing and responsiveness?"
- "Please add comments in this React component to improve code readability."
- "How to slightly enhance this component UI based on best practices?"

These prompts were focused on small refinements, not code generation.

---

## ðŸ§  Areas Assisted by AI

AI was used specifically for:

- Enhancing visual structure using **Tailwind CSS** adjustments
- Adding meaningful **code comments** for better maintainability
- Suggesting **responsive improvements** to align with Figma where minor gaps existed

---

## âœ… Validation of AI Suggestions

All AI suggestions were:

- **Manually reviewed** before implementation
- Verified through **browser testing**
- Compared against the **Figma design** to ensure alignment
- Adjusted to meet project-specific design guidelines

---

## ðŸ“Œ Limitations

- No business logic, component architecture was built using AI.
- All core functionality, logic, and structural decisions were done manually.
- AI was used purely as a helper for **UI polish and readability**.
